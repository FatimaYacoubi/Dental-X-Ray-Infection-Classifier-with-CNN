A mini project to get familirized with Deep learning and Image Classifying with CNN 
Detects if an image of a Dental X-Ray has an infection ( which is indicated by a black area near the root or the side of the tooth) or not.
for example:

in this image we don't see a black area close to the root so = no infection
